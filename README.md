# PySpy - A simple EVE Online character intel tool using CCP's ESI API

## Background

PySpy was born out of frustration over the *death* of [Pirate's Little Helper](http://eve-plh.com/#/home),
a great [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) third-party tool to gather useful information on character names from the in-game *local chat* window.

PySpy connects to [CCP's ESI API](https://esi.evetech.net/ui/) and
[zKillboard's API](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/wiki) and is available on Windows and macOS.

## How to use PySpy

1. Open PySpy, position the window and adjust transparency (bottom left slider). PySpy will stay on top of the EVE client so long as the game runs in *window mode*.
2. In your EVE client, select a list of characters and copy them to the clipboard (Mac: `âŒ˜+C` / Windows: `CTRL+C`)
3. Wait until PySpy is done and inspect the results.
4. Double-click a name to open the respective zKillboard in your browser.
